# MTech

In this repository you can find code for hypothesis testing on mtech data. To see the web application you can follow this [link](https://mtechapp.streamlit.app/).

All underlying code and explanations you can check in this [notebook](https://github.com/privet1mir/MTech/blob/main/mtech.ipynb). 
The project consists of several parts. In the beggining you can upload your csv file and test two of the hypothesis: 

1. Men miss more than 2 working days (work_days) during the year due to illness significantly more often than women
2. Workers over 35 years of age (age) miss more than 2 working days (work_days) due to illness during the year significantly more often than their younger colleagues

All corresponding distribution graphs and results of testing you can see on web application. Also I implemented Bootstrapping to count the significant interval of missed days both for two groups.
